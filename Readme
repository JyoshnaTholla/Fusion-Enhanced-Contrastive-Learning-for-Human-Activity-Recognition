# 🏃‍♀️ Fusion-Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

This project presents a **Temporal Fusion Contrastive Learning (TFCL) framework** for **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using wearable sensor data.  
It integrates **biometric features** (e.g., age, height, gait) with **sensor data** (accelerometer, gyroscope) to enable **robust, personalized, and privacy-aware recognition**.  

A **web-based application**, deployed using **WAMP server**, provides real-time and historical activity visualization, making the framework interactive and accessible.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Human Activity Recognition plays a vital role in fitness tracking, healthcare, and smart wearables.  
However, existing HAR models:  
- Depend heavily on **labeled datasets**, which are expensive and privacy-sensitive.  
- Fail to **generalize across users**, reducing personalization and adaptability.  

This project addresses these challenges with a **fusion-enhanced self-supervised learning approach**.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **TFCL (Proposed Framework):**  
  - Combines **sensor data** (accelerometer, gyroscope) with **biometric metadata**.  
  - Uses **contrastive learning** to learn robust, adaptive representations.  

- **Baselines for Comparison:**  
  - Deep Learning: CNN, LSTM  
  - Classical ML: SVM, Random Forest, KNN
