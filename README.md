# Fusion-Enhanced-Contrastive-Learning-for-Human-Activity-Recognition
 Developing a Temporal Fusion Contrastive Learning (TFCL) framework for Human Activity Recognition using wearable sensors. By fusing biometric features with accelerometer and gyroscope data, TFCL achieved superior accuracy over CNN, LSTM, and ML models, with a web app for real-time activity visualization.
