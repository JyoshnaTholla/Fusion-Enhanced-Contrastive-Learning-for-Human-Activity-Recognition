🏗️ Model Architectures
🔹 Proposed Model: TFCL (Temporal Fusion Contrastive Learning)

Fusion Layer: Combines raw sensor signals (accelerometer, gyroscope) with biometric metadata (age, height, gait).

Contrastive Learning: Learns robust representations from unlabeled sequences by pulling similar activities closer and pushing dissimilar ones apart.

Temporal Modeling: Captures sequential dependencies in activities using temporal encoding.

Personalization: Biometric fusion enables better generalization across different users.

🔹 Baseline Models

1. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):

Extracts spatial features from sensor time-series windows.

Lightweight and efficient for real-time HAR.

Limitation: Cannot model long temporal dependencies.

2. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):

Captures temporal patterns in sequential sensor data.

Strong at modeling long-term dependencies.

Limitation: Slower training compared to CNN.

3. Classical ML Models:

SVM, Random Forest, KNN trained on handcrafted statistical + frequency features.

Provide strong baselines but underperform compared to deep learning models.
